title: New project! Cobold Patient Portal!
---

I'm starting a small project for my sister. It's a patient portal for her clients so she is able to manage health information for each patient. [You can follow the project here.](https://github.com/jeffreytu/cobold-patient-portal)

Here are some features of the initial system:
- Easy registration and login
- Add profile information, including health metrics
- History of visits
- Realtime appointment booking system

In the future I would like to expand the features to have:
- Health discussion board
- Private message inbox

Most of this will be a learning process for me. I would greatly appreciate any help and pointers! Do please scream at me if you see something horrendous.
